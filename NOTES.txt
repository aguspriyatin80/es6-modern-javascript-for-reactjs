PART 01: INTRODUCTION
# ES6 Fitures:
- Variable creation using 'let' and 'const'
- Template Strings
- Arrow Functions
- Rest and Spread Operator
- Destructuring
- Array functions: find(), findIndex(), map(), reduce(), filter()
- Classes
- Promises, etc.
# Babel
- It is a preprocessor Javascript/ECMAScript. 
- It is mainly used to convert ES6+ code into a backwards compatible version of Javascript than can be run by older browser
- babeljs.io 

PART 02: VARIABEL CREATING USING 'LET' AND 'CONST'
# Creating Variables
- ES6 introduced two new ways to create Variables
- 'let' : it is like a replacement for 'var'
- for example:
let mName = "Agus"
let mSum = 100
- 'const': it used to create variables with constant values also known as constants. The variables created using const cannot be updated later in the code. 
- For example:
const API_URL = "http://api.test.com/v1"
